## Proposed Design for the Photography Studio Landing Page

### HTML Files
1. **landing_page.html**: This HTML file will serve as the main landing page for the photography studio. It will contain the following elements:
    - Logo and business name
    - Hero image
    - Welcome message
    - Text box for name, email address, and phone number
    - Drop-down menu for attendees to select a time slot for their photoshoot
    - Calendar tool for attendees to select a date
    - Payment function that accepts credit cards
    - Button for final submission
    - Social media links
    - Contact information

2. **confirmation.html**: This HTML file will be displayed after a successful submission. It will contain the following elements:
    - Confirmation message
    - Attendee's registration information
    - Download link for the spreadsheet containing the list of registered attendees
    - Return link to the landing page

3. **spreadsheet.csv**: This CSV file will contain a list of all the people who have registered for the photoshoot. Each row will include the following information:
    - Name
    - Email address
    - Phone number
    - Time slot
    - Date
    - Payment status

### Routes
1. **Home Route**: This route will handle the landing page. When a user visits the homepage, this route will render the `landing_page.html` file.
2. **Registration Route**: This route will handle the registration process. When a user clicks the submit button on the landing page, this route will collect the information provided by the user and save it to the `spreadsheet.csv` file. It will then render the `confirmation.html` file.
3. **Download Route**: This route will handle the download of the `spreadsheet.csv` file. When a user clicks the download link on the confirmation page, this route will send the file to the user's computer.

### Additional Considerations
- **Email Confirmation**: The registration route should trigger an email confirmation to be sent to the attendee's email address. This email should include their registration information and a link to the confirmation page.
- **Data Validation**: The registration route should include data validation to ensure that the information provided by the user is valid. For example, the email address should be in a valid format, and the time slot and date should be available.
- **Security**: Measures should be taken to secure the application from potential vulnerabilities, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
